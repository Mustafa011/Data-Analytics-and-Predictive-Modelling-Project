# Data-Analytics-and-Predictive-Modelling-Project
Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Conditions: This repository contains code and resources for analyzing obesity levels using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting obesity levels based on individuals' eating habits and physical conditions. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Estimation of Obesity Levels Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition).

The aim of this analysis is to:
1. Explore and visualize the dataset.
2. Build machine learning models (Clustering, Classification and Regression Analysis) to predict obesity levels.
3. Evaluate the impact of eating habits and physical activity on obesity.

## Dataset
**Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
**Description**: The dataset contains information about individuals' eating habits, physical activities, and obesity levels, labeled into different categories.  
**Features**:
- Age, gender, and physical activity levels.
- Frequency of food consumption (e.g., high-calorie food, vegetables, etc.).
- Target variable: Obesity Level (categorical).
